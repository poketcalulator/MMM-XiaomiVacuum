# miIO Device Library

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/miio.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/miio)
[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/aholstenson/miio.svg)](https://david-dm.org/aholstenson/miio)

Control Mi Home devices that implement the miIO protocol, such as the
Mi Air Purifier, Mi Robot Vacuum and Mi Smart Socket. These devices are commonly
part of what Xiaomi calls the Mi Ecosystem which is branded as MiJia.

`miio` is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) and requires at least Node 6.6.0. As
the API is promise-based Node 8 is recommended which provides support `async`
and `await` that greatly simplifies asynchronous handling.

**Note:** Since 0.15.0 this library has been rewritten to use [abstract-things](https://github.com/tinkerhub/abstract-things)
as its base. The API of devices will have changed, and some bugs are to be
expected. Testing and feedback on the new API is welcome, please open issues
as needed.

## Devices types

The intent of this library is to support all miIO-compatible devices and to
provide an easy to use API for them. The library maps specific device models to
generic device types with well defined capabilities to simplify interacting with
them.

Currently supported devices are:

* Air Purifiers (1, 2 and Pro)
* Mi Humidifier
* Mi Smart Socket Plug and Power Strips
* Mi Robot Vacuum (V1 and V2)
* Mi Smart Home Gateway (Aqara) and accessories - switches, sensors, etc
* Philips Light Bulb and Eyecare Lamp
* Yeelights (White Bulb, Color Bulb, Desk Lamp and Strip)

See [documentation for devices](docs/devices/README.md) for information about
the types, their API and supported device models. You can also check
[Missing devices](docs/missing-devices.md) if you want to know what you can do
to help this library with support for your device.

## Installation

To install into your project:

```
npm install miio
```

To install globally for access to the command line tool:

```
npm install -g miio
```

## Usage

```javascript
const miio = require('miio');
```

Resolve a handle to the device:

```javascript
// Resolve a device, resolving the token automatically or from storage
miio.device({ address: '192.168.100.8' })
  .then(device => console.log('Connected to', device))
  .catch(err => handleErrorHere);

// Resolve a device, specifying the token (see below for how to get the token)
miio.device({ address: '192.168.100.8', token: 'token-as-hex' })
  .then(device => console.log('Connected to', device))
  .catch(err => handleErrorHere);
```

Call methods to interact with the device:

```javascript
// Switch the power of the device
device.togglePower()
  .then(on => console.log('Power is now', on))
  .catch(err => handleErrorHere);

// Using async/await
await device.togglePower();
```

Listen to events such as property changes and actions:

```javascript
// Listen for power changes
device.on('power', power => console.log('Power changed to', power));

// The device is available for event handlers
const handler = ({ action }, device) => console.log('Action', action, 'performed on', device);
device1.on('action', handler);
device2.on('action', handler);
```

Capabilities and types are used to hint about what a device can do:

```javascript
if(device.matches('cap:temperature')) {
  console.log(await device.temperature());
}

if(device.matches('cap:switchable-power')) {
  device.setPower(false)
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
}
```

If you are done with the device call `destroy` to stop all network traffic:

```javascript
device.destroy();
```

## Tokens and device management

A few miIO devices send back their token during a handshake and can be used
without figuring out the token. Most devices hide their token, such as
Yeelights and the Mi Robot Vacuum.

There is a command line tool named `miio` that helps with finding and storing
tokens. See [Device management](docs/management.md) for details
and common use cases.

## Discovering devices

Use `miio.devices()` to look for and connect to devices on the local network.
This method of discovery will tell you directly if a device reveals its token
and can be auto-connected to. If you do not want to automatically connect to
devices you can use `miio.browse()` instead.

Example using `miio.devices()`:

```javascript
const devices = miio.devices({
  cacheTime: 300 // 5 minutes. Default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
});

devices.on('available', device => {
  if(device.matches('placeholder')) {
    // This device is either missing a token or could not be connected to
  } else {
    // Do something useful with device
  }
});

devices.on('unavailable', device => {
  // Device is no longer available and is destroyed
});
```

`miio.devices()` supports these options:

* `cacheTime`, the maximum amount of seconds a device can be unreachable before it becomes unavailable. Default: `1800`
* `filter`, function used to filter what devices are connected to. Default: `reg => true`
* `skipSubDevices`, if sub devices on Aqara gateways should be skipped. Default: `false`
* `useTokenStorage`, if tokens should be fetched from storage (see device management). Default: `true`
* `tokens`, object with manual mapping between ids and tokens (advanced, use [Device management](docs/management.md) if possible)

See [Advanced API](docs/advanced-api.md) for details about `miio.browse()`.

## Device API

Check [documentation for devices](docs/devices/README.md) for details about
the API for supported devices. Detailed documentation of the core API is
available in the section [Using things in the abstract-things documentation](http://abstract-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-things.html).

## Library versioning and API stability

This library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) with an exception
being that the API for devices is based on their type and capabilities and not
their model.

This means that a device can have methods removed if its type or capabilities
change, which can happen if a better implementation is made available for the
model. When working with the library implement checks against type and
capabilities for future compatibility within the same major version of `miio`.

Capabilities can be considered stable across major versions, if a device
supports `power` no minor or patch version will introduce `power-mega` and
replace `power`. If new functionality is needed the new capability will be
added along side the older one.

## Reporting issues

[Reporting issues](docs/reporting-issues.md) contains information that is
useful for making any issue you want to report easier to fix.

## Debugging

The library uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) with two
namespaces, `miio` is used for packet details and network discovery and devices
use the `thing:miio` namespace. These are controlled via the `DEBUG`
environment flag. The flag can be set while running the miio command or any
NodeJS script:

Show debug info about devices during discovery:

```
$ DEBUG=thing\* miio discover
```

To activate both namespaces set `DEBUG` to both:

```
$ DEBUG=miio\*,thing\* miio discover
```

## Protocol documentation

This library is based on the documentation provided by OpenMiHome. See https://github.com/OpenMiHome/mihome-binary-protocol for details. For details
about how to figure out the commands for new devices look at the
[documentation for protocol and commands](docs/protocol.md).
